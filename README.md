# nvidia-3080-script

Will check the german API in the nvidia store to see if an 3080 FE is available. If so, makes noise, sends email and telegram and opens Chrome with the shop page.

This script will not buy the card for you!

Usage:
1. install node.js with npm
2. (optional) change hardcoded email, telegram etc. info below
3. run "npm install"
4. finally run "npm start"
